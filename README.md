- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mstrucka, based in Copenhagen, Denmark.
- Iâ€™m currently both a student (bachelor's in Computer Science) and a part time developer, learning mostly backend technologies, mostly Java and .NET, with a few ongoing Typescript projects as well.
- However, I try to consistently educate myself in the frontend technologies as well, currently dabbling with React
